Let's be completely honest, we all knew it was going to happen.
You start a new blog (maybe you've even built the engine yourself), add some
enthusiastic new posts, start publishing fairly regularly... And then at
some point you start procrastinating a bit, telling yourself that next
weekend you are going to write about this new thing you've found and
without knowing it has been eight months since your last post.

Well, in my defence I have to say it has been a pretty busy year.
Last March I started working full time for the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org).
The OKF is a not-for-profit devoted to promoting open access to knowledge
and data, and it is involved in a ridiculous amount of awesome projects.
Check for instance the [annotated works of Shakespeare](http://openshakespeare.org), [OpenSpending](http://openspending.org), an effort to structure and visualize government budget spending, and one of my favourites, [the Public Domain Review](http://publicdomainreview.org). You can find more active [projects](http://okfn.org/projects) and [mailing lists](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo) on the OKF website, and if you want to meet brilliant and talented people do not hesitate to get involved!

One of the main projects of the OKF, and the one I work full-time on, is
[CKAN](http://ckan.org), an [open source](https://github.com/okfn/ckan)
data catalog platform. The aim of CKAN is to provide a robust and flexible
platform for publishing, discovering and sharing data. It powers
institutional catalogs like the [British](http://data.gov.uk) and
[Norwegian](http://data.norge.no/) government open data catalogs, as well as community instances
like [The Data Hub](http://thedatahub.org) or the ones maintained in
[different countries](http://wiki.ckan.org/Instances).

The first project I was involved with was the UK Location Programme. It is
integrated with the mentioned Data.gov.uk (DGU), and it acts as the
spatial data infrastucture for supporting the pan-european INSPIRE
directive. A lot of work on this front was related with harvesting
multiple CSW servers to aggregate their records in the DGU portal.

Another really interesting OKF project I worked on was [Publicdata.eu](http://publicdata.eu), an experimental portal that aggregated open datasets from
catalogs across Europe. My colleague Friedrich Lindenberg wrote a [nice post](http://ckan.org/2011/06/23/publicdata-eu-data-apps-and-800000-triples/) presenting it, if you want to know more about it. I was even able to squeeze
a couple of [maps](http://publicdata.eu/map) in there!

One of the projects I've been more involved recently is the [IATI Registry](http://iatiregistry.org), also powered by CKAN. [IATI](http://www.aidtransparency.net/) is an international
initiative to promote transparency on aid spending. It provides a common 
[standard](http://iatistandard.org/) on which funding organisations can publish their activities,
allowing stakeholders and third-parties to analyze and visualize this
spending data. The registry provides a centralized point where organisations can publish their IATI compliant files so users can access them via the web interface or the API.

And of course, apart from working on specific projects I've been involved
in the usual day to day tasks in a big open source project like
CKAN, building features, fixing bugs, supporting users... All of this with
a brilliant (remote) team and learning an awful lot of stuff on the way!

So all in all, 2011 has been an intense and exciting year and it looks like 2012 won't dissapoint either, with new projects and features coming up.

Hopefully it won't take me months to tell you about them.

Happy New Year!
