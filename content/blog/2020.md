Well, what can I say? It sucked.

While we are lucky that Covid didn't took anyone from our close circle of family and friends, it has shaped our lives for most of the year, in the same way it has shaped them for most people around the world. Lockdowns, restrictions, anxiety, kids at home for extended periods of time, PCRs... You probably know the drill so I won't go into that.

I'd rather focus on the things that brought me joy and allowed to me to park my worries for a bit

For obvious reasons there wasn't much travelling for me on 2020. Nothing work related and just one short trip in summer for holidays to the beautiful [Valle de Tena](https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=valle%20de%20tena) in the Pyrenees. Impressive mountains and beautiful lakes, with some great hiking to clear your mind (wiggly toddler in the baby carrier allowing).

And just another even shorter trip to the [Terra Alta](https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=terra%20alta), a wild and sparsely populated area not far from our hometown, with some great spots for having a swim in freezing cold river pools.
