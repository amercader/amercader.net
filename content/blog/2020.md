Well, what can I say? It sucked.

While we are lucky that Covid didn't took anyone from our close circle of family and friends, it has shaped our lives for most of the year, in the same way it has shaped them for most people around the world. Lockdowns, restrictions, anxiety, kids at home for extended periods of time, PCRs... You probably know the drill so I won't go into that.

I'd rather focus on the things that brought me joy and allowed to me to park my worries for a bit

For obvious reasons there wasn't much travelling for me on 2020. Nothing work related and just one short trip in summer for holidays to the beautiful [Valle de Tena](https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=valle%20de%20tena) in the Pyrenees. Impressive mountains and beautiful lakes, with some great hiking to clear your mind (wiggly toddler in the baby carrier allowing).

And just another even shorter trip to the [Terra Alta](https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=terra%20alta), a wild and sparsely populated area not far from our hometown, with some great spots for having a swim in freezing cold river pools.

When things quieted down at the end of the day I really didn't feel like going back to the computer. This year I really felt screen fatigue, specially at the peak of the lockdown period, and until a couple of weeks ago when I wrote [Munibot](https://amercader.net/blog/munibot-the-friendly-geo-twitter-bot/) I almost hadn't worked on any side project. Also [three blog](https://amercader.net/blog/) posts in a year isn't a massive amount, but hey, I didn't feel like writing (or finishing the posts, I found three drafts laying around).

What I spent most of my scarce free time on was reading. I read some good novels like [Sim√≥n](https://blackiebooks.org/catalogo/simon/) but it is comics where I found myself lost time and time again. I read tons of them all across the board, but if I had to choose the one that stood out it would be [My Favourite Thing Is Monsters](https://www.fantagraphics.com/products/my-favorite-thing-is-monsters). You should 100% believe the hype around this book, it is truly incredible. The art is mind-boggling, the writing solid and gripping, and when you learn the story of how Emil Ferris produced this book, it makes it even more remarkable. Definitely recommended.

For my birthday I treated myself to the [Akira 35th Anniversary Box Set](https://kodanshacomics.com/series/akira-35th-anniversary-box-set/). I was *very* lucky to snap this year's new edition on Amazon for a bargain price and boy was it worth it. It is a really high quality collection, with lots of attention put into the packaging and volumes. Good quality paper, right to left reading and original sound effects (if you are into that level of nerdiness). If you want to get a full run of Akira this is an excellent edition, with the major caveat that is now really hard to find at a reasonable price.

Things definitely picked up on the running front in 2020. I managed to carve out more time for it and get into a more regular schedule (when not in lockdown, clearly marked in the graph below), which helped a lot in making progress. I steadily increased the distance until running over 10k for the first time in a couple of years, which felt great.

I'm feeling good starting the new year, and my aim is to consolidate the 10k distance and slowly work towards bigger ones. Who knows maybe a half marathon towards the end of 2021? But I don't put any pressure at all on me, and if it needs to be on 2022 so be it.
