Another year flew by! This one really felt like it passed extremely fast. There were no major events or disruptions, just the ebbs and flows of daily life. Luckily we've all been healthy except for regular non-Covid stuff. Hope that is the case on your end too.

Like the previous year, no international travel in 2021. Countless virtual work meetings all around the world, but no work trips yet. We only did some local trips on [summer](/blog/casual-openstreetmapping) and winter holidays to change the scenery for a few days.

Things are bound to change in 2022, as, pandemic permitting, we'll have an OKF summit in Montenegro. I've never visited it and I'm looking forward to it.

I read a lot this year, both books and comics.

My favourite book was [Canto jo i la muntanya balla](https://www.anagrama-ed.es/foreign-rights/book/llibres-anagrama/canto-jo-i-la-muntanya-balla/9788433915689/LA_61) by Irene Sol√†, which I think will be soon translated to [many different languages](https://www.anagrama-ed.es/noticias/contratos-de-traduccion/contratos-de-traduccion-2020-452), including [English](https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/when-i-sing-mountains-dance), so if you find it in one you read I strongly recommend it.

Comics-wise it is hard to pick a favourite, but I very much enjoyed revisiting Simon Hanselmann's [Crisis Zone](https://www.fantagraphics.com/products/crisis-zone) in book form after being a loyal follower of its Instagram serialization. Definitely worth mentioning [Grip](https://www.perfectly-acceptable.com/item/grip-collected/) by Lale Westwind (even if it's not a 2021 book) because I absolutely loved its art.

And speaking of art, Brian Blomerth's [Mycelium Wassonii](https://intl.shop.mexicansummer.com/merch/251031-brian-blomerth-mycelium-wassonii) is also really recommended if you are into alternative styles and interesting visuals. I've never seen a book like this. The art is amazing and supports a very interesting story about the origins of psychedelic mushrooms usage in the US. I enjoyed it a lot.

Good feelings on the running front. My 2021 goal was to consolidate the 10k and that has definitely been achieved. I ran 59 times totalling 532 Km, up from 435 Km in 2020 and 288 Km in 2019, so I'm really happy with that.

The goal for 2022 is to keep working slowly towards longer distances, and maybe run a couple of races.

It's also been a good year at work. After being CEO-less for a long while we finally got a [new boss](https://blog.okfn.org/2021/10/12/a-new-ceo-for-open-knowledge-foundation-renata-avila/)! She is great and brought lots of new ideas and good energy for next year.

I've been taking more responsibilities as Tech Lead, which has meant more scoping, designing and code reviewing, and a bit less actual coding. I also found myself having to do things like hiring, line management, etc, and luckily I found that you can learn how to be better at those just in the same way that you can learn any other skill.

We have a great team, and if you are a developer looking for a place to grow working with nice and talented people you should [apply for our open position](https://okfn.org/about/jobs/software-developer-december-2021/) (there's another exciting one for a [comms person](https://okfn.org/about/jobs/communications-coordinator-december-2021/)!).

As for CKAN, 2022 is bound to be a very exciting year. There's been a ton of great work done during 2021 that will be made available in the next major release, for which we are getting geared towards. Besides that we have an amazing diversity-related project in the works of which I'm super proud, I can't wait to be able to tell more!

I hope you all have a wonderful 2022.
