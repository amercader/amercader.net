I've been slacking off on these yearly updates for a while, but this year I
have a bit more time in my hands (more on this later), so here we go.

Overall, 2025... Fine, I guess. I can't complain on any of the important
fronts, and I feel very grateful for that, but it has felt like a long year.
It's hard not to feel deflated at times because of the whole ...*[gestures at
everything]*, and to be honest I reached the end of the year with low energy
levels. 

Let's focus on the good stuff though!

This year I started seriously tracking what I read. I tried many services and
apps in the past but I ended up using just a Google Spreadsheet. Title and date
started and finished, plus ISBN code in case I want to do something fancier in
the future and want to get the book details. 

I won't bore you with graphs, the summary is that I read 18 books and 51 comics, 31 of them
loaned from the local public library. We are big fans, my kids and I
go there once a month and stock up.

If I had to choose some random year favourites they would probably be [One Day I'll Write about This Place](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9905586-one-day-i-will-write-about-this-place) by Binyavanga Wainaina,
[A Drifting Life](https://drawnandquarterly.com/books/a-drifting-life-paperback/) by Yoshihiro Tatsumi, [How Much Land Does a Man Need?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Much_Land_Does_a_Man_Need%3F) and other short stories by Lev Tolstoi and [Sharazad](https://goodokbad.com/reviews/sharaz_de_tales_from_the_arabian_nights_review.php) by Sergio Toppi.

<a id="traveling"></a>
As usual, a mix of pleasure and work-related trips this year. Last summer I
went with my family to the Aragón side of the Pyrenees, near Ordesa. Some
incredible geology and landscapes, and we got to do a couple of really nice
hikes despite the heat.

I briefly returned to Newcastle upon Tyne, the place we called home for almost eight
years, for a short visit with friends. It was remarkably unchanged and we could
visit all the nice spots in town and around it.

In September I flew to Bologna to attend [CSV,conf](https://csvconf.com/), where I helped deliver a
CKAN workshop. I think it was my fifth attendance to CSV,conf and as usual it
was a great event. Bologna was fantastic, I loved the laid back atmosphere and
the never ending arcades (and the amazing food of course).

A month later I travelled for the first time to Vitoria-Gasteiz to attend the
[OGP Summit](https://spain.ogpsummit.org/p/#/). I was pleasantly surprised by Vitoria, very walkable, nice old town
and world-class pinchos.

And to end the year a short trip to the mountains near [Camprodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camprodon) to see the snow (we are
southerners and get easily excited by it).

On the running front, this has been a quiet year. I run a half marathon at the
end of 2024 and even though it was my personal best I didn't feel super well,
so I decided to take it slow after that. Besides, July and August were too hot,
and I stupidly broke my toe in September when it was nice again to go out. Luckily I
recovered quite quickly and ended up the year in a decent form.

The highlight was for sure the orienteering race I run with my eldest son, his
first one! It was a 1.5 hours
[rogaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogaining) that took place in the
beautiful town of [Miravet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miravet), next to the Ebre river, with spectacular scenery. But best of all is that we managed to win our category! 🎉

<a id="working"></a>
Work-wise, I was lucky to work with the talented team at Link Digital for
almost two years. Besides some really important CKAN stuff I got to work on
interesting projects and to improve internal processes with some great
colleagues. Sadly the circumstances were not right so our engagement was ended
amicably. Which means I am now idle, catching up on personal projects and learning
new things, but definitely planning on looking for a job, so perhaps you want
to consider [hiring me](/hire-me)!

I hope that you and yours have a great 2026.
