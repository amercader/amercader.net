Here is a really nice video produced by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/) introducing [Open Government Data](http://opengovernmentdata.org/).

<div class="image">
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://s3.www.universalsubtitles.org/embed.js">
(
  {"base_state": {"language": "ca"}, "video_url": "http://vimeo.com/21711338"}
)
</script>
</div>

Notice the subtitles options below the video. It is using [Universal Subtitles](http://www.universalsubtitles.org), an online service that makes really easy to add or edit subtitles to existing videos. I helped creating the Catalan version of the subtitles and found it a brilliant idea. You can edit the translations on site or download the file and upload the changes. 

By the way, if there are any Catalan readers willing to proofread and correct the subtitles, please go ahead...
