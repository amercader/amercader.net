Probably not.

Some say blogs are not cool any more (i.e. they are "dead"), left
behind by the frantic pace of Twitter and Facebook. News and ideas are more and
more condensed to fit the sacred 140 characters, and they become outdated sooner
than ever before. I use Twitter and Facebook daily, but I still found the most
interesting and useful resources reading blogs. I value the effort the authors 
(at least some of them) put into presenting their ideas and knowledge. So I
thought I could spend some time sharing some of my thoughts too.

A couple of quick facts for those of you who don't know me:

* I was born in [Tarragona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarragona) and I'm
currently living in the UK, in Newcastle upon Tyne.
* I'm a web developer with a strong background in the geospatial field. I work
with Open software and standards.
* If I had to choose three pieces of software to take to a desert island, I
would probably pick [Python](http://python.org), [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org)
and [PostGIS](http://postgis.refractions.net).

As a proper hacker, I wrote my own website and blog engine (with [Pylons](http://
pylonshq.org), in case you were wondering) so please bear with me if you find some
glitch or odd behaviour. You can subscribe to the [Atom](http://amercader.net/feeds/posts.atom)
or [RSS](http://amercader.net/feeds/posts.rss) feeds or follow me on [@amercader](http://twitter.com/amercader) 
to hear about new posts.

If you made it this far, thanks for your time and hope to see you around!
