I've been working on technical roles for two decades now, both being part of
development teams and managing them. In most cases the technology itself wasn't
the main driver of what I was doing, but rather what it could be used for.

Most of my recent roles could be probably described as Tech Lead or Senior
Architect, but I've worked in small organizations where one had to take on many
hats so at some point I've also acted as Engineering Manager, Senior Developer,
Product Owner, etc. I don't get too hung up on job titles anyway.

When leading teams, I try to create the space where people can grow and play to
their strengths, while keeping goals and deadlines on track. When being part of a
team I love learning from my colleagues and be trusted to make my own
decisions. In any case, I'll be fastidious about things that improve the
code quality and make life easier in the long term: tests, linting, automation,
observability, etc.

I'm comfortable talking with clients and stakeholders, understanding their requirements
and translating them into tasks, but also suggesting alternatives if I think
there might be a better approach. I like debugging issues and reviewing code,
and I write good documentation.

Unless you have offices around [Tarragona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarragona)
I'm looking for remote work. I'm based in UTC+1 / UTC+2 but happy to wake up early
if needed (evenings are a bit trickier because of family life).

The majority of my work has centered in some way or another around data: data publication,
data cleaning and validation, data pipelines, metadata standards, etc.

I work mostly in Python, but I don't mind working with other languages if I'm
given enough room to get familiar with them. I'm familiar with Docker, CI/CD and other
DevOps technologies, and I have worked on projects hosted on all major cloud providers.

I'm one of the maintainers of the [CKAN](https://ckan.org) project, so I have
deep knowledge about extending and customizing it. I maintain some of its most
popular extensions, including the ones adding [spatial
capabilities](https://docs.ckan.org/projects/ckanext-spatial) and support
for metadata standards like [DCAT or
Croissant](https://docs.ckan.org/projects/ckanext-dcat/en/latest/).

If the box above says I'm looking for a job, and you think I might be a good fit
for a role you have open, please get in touch. In fact, get in touch even if it
says I am not, I sometimes can take small consulting jobs or point you to the
right person or company.

Looking forward to connecting.
